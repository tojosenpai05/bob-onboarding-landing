# Start here, Alex

You received these files. Do them in this order (roughly 30 minutes):

1. northwind-labs-onboarding-alex-tan.pdf: your onboarding pack. Read this first (about 20 minutes): the company, your role, the codebase, your first tasks and your first week.
2. northwind-labs-onboarding-alex-tan-tour.mp4: a short narrated video tour of the codebase, with captions. Watch it after the PDF and before you open the code.
3. northwind-labs-onboarding-alex-tan-context.zip: the context for Bob IDE (your personal AI assistant for this codebase). Do not read it by hand: load it into Bob with the steps below.

## Set up Bob IDE with this folder

1. Install Bob IDE from https://bob.ibm.com/download and sign in. Your account is arranged on day 1: see "Day-1 accounts & access" in the PDF.
2. Create a folder called onboarding-workspace. Unzip the context zip into it (Windows: right-click, Extract All) so you have onboarding-workspace/context/.
3. Get the code: clone the project into the same folder (onboarding-workspace/<project>). The address is in the PDF under "Where things live"; if it is not there, ask Daniel Wong.
4. In Bob IDE choose File, Open Folder and pick onboarding-workspace. If Bob asks whether you trust the authors, choose Yes.
5. Copy context/AGENTS.md up one level to onboarding-workspace/AGENTS.md. Bob loads an AGENTS.md at the workspace root into every new conversation automatically; inside context/ it would not be loaded.
6. Open Bob's chat (Ctrl+Alt+B on Windows, Option+Cmd+B on Mac, or the Bob icon), start a new conversation with the plus sign, and send: Read @/context/README.md and help me finish the setup.

To install the project's dependencies, ask Bob to run this (it only reads the manifest and installs, no sudo):

```
python context/scripts/install_deps.py <path to your clone> --check
```

Drop --check to install for real. On Windows use py instead of python if python is not found.

## How to work with Bob here

- Ask mode is read-only: use it to explore. Agent mode can change files and run commands, always asking first: approve only what you understand, and keep auto-approve off while you learn.
- Point Bob at files with @, for example @/context/architecture.md. Avoid mentioning whole folders: it is slower and costs more.
- Good first questions: Walk me through the code tour in @/context/architecture.md. Which issue should I start with, and why? What do I need to know before I touch the data layer?
- Bob only knows what is in these files. Where they say "Unknown — ask your buddy", ask Daniel Wong. Never paste passwords or keys into a chat.

## What is in this folder

- AGENTS.md: the instructions Bob reads first: who you are, the rules, where things are
- architecture.md: how the system is built, one request end to end, and the code tour
- company.md: what the company does and how it works
- issues/INDEX.md: the known problems, one line each
- issues/ISSUE-NNN-*.md (10 files): one known problem each, with evidence, guidance to solve it and how to verify it
- role.md: your role and what success looks like in 30 days
- scripts/install_deps.py: installs the project's declared dependencies (no sudo)
- tech-stack.md: what the project needs installed, and why
- timeline.md: your dates, starter tasks and week-1 checkpoints
